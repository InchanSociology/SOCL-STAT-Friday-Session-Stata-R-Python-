# SOCL-STAT-Friday-Session-Stata-R-Python-
This is an extension of the Friday Stata sessions from the SOCL STAT: BASIC CONCEPTS AND METHODS course for first-year sociology students at UT Austin. I’ve recreated the same functionalities in R and Python, so you can use them just like we do in Stata during our Friday sessions.

Each weekly folder contains command files in different formats: `.R` for R scripts, `.ipynb` for Python notebooks, and `.do` for Stata do-files.  
If you have any questions related to R, Python, or Stata — or if you'd like to discuss statistical methods or research methodology — feel free to reach out to Inchan Hwang (ih6282@my.utexas.edu or Whatsapp)
I'd be happy to help or have a thoughtful conversation about your ideas!
