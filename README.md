# SOCL-STAT-Friday-Session-Stata-R-Python-
This is an extension of the Friday Stata sessions from the SOCL STAT: BASIC CONCEPTS AND METHODS course for first-year sociology students at UT Austin. Iâ€™ve recreated the same functionalities in R and Python, so you can use them just like we do in Stata during our Friday sessions.
